These are base cases written for execution on 1 core to ensure consistency.
Copy these to working directories and rename to P_1 for duplication for more cores.

Note that these are written with decomposePar files, set to 1 process and (1 1 1) decomposition.
This file is never run for the single core case but is here to enable easy duplication and modification for parallel runs.

Update:
These have now been changed to use Scotch decomposition, since this is easier to use for using 76 cores on a node.
